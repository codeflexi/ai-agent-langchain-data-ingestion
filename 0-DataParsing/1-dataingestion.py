Python is a high-level, interpreted programming language known for its simplicity and readability.
Created by Guido van Rossum and first released in 1991, Python has become one of the most popular
programming languages in the world.

Key Features:
- Easy to learn and use
- Extensive standard library
- Cross-platform compatibility
- Strong community support 123

Python is widely used in web development, data science, artificial intelligence, and automation.""",

Machine learning is a subset of artificial intelligence that enables systems to learn and improve
from experience without being explicitly programmed. It focuses on developing computer programs
that can access data and use it to learn for themselves.

Types of Machine Learning:
1. Supervised Learning: Learning with labeled data
2. Unsupervised Learning: Finding patterns in unlabeled data
3. Reinforcement Learning: Learning through rewards and penalties 345

Applications include image recognition, speech processing, and recommendation systems"""
